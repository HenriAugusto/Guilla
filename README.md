## Installing and how to use

If you don't have one create a path where you're going to store all of your externals. For example: _"C:\Users\User\Dropbox\PureData\shared extras"_;

Open Pure Data and go to **File->preferences->path** and add a path to that directory.

Do **not** create a path directly to your externals. By using a shared folder you can use folders like namespaces.

See [How to install externals, libraries, gui plug-ins, etc.](https://forum.pdpatchrepo.info/topic/6743/how-to-install-externals-libraries-gui-plug-ins-etc) on that. The method you should use is the one described in that page on the section _"Loading objects or abstractions using namespaces"_.
